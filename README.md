Ethernauts + Hardhat Levels 6 - 12
A small repo that contains the solutions for Ethernauts levels 6 - 12. The solutions are written in Solidity and tested using Hardhat.
The levels are from the Ethernauts game, which can be found here: https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/

I've solved all of the levels to identify some of the security issues that can be found in Solidity smart contracts.

Ethernaut Levels
Ethernaut consists of a total of 28 levels. I've decided to solve them in the following environments:

Levels 1-5 are solvable using the console and are not included in this repo (due to their simplicity).
Levels 6-12 are solved using Hardhat and are included in this repo.
Levels 13-28 will be solved using Foundry and will be included in another repo in the future.
